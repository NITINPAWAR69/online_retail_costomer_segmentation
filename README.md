Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a companyâ€™s customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business. The contents of the dataset had features such as invoiceno., stockcode, description, quantity, unitprice, customerID, and country. The problem statement was to build an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform customer segmentation. We started with data wrangling in which we tried to handle null values, duplicates and performed feature modifications.
